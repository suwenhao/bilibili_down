/// Platform-unified FFplay video output surface.
///
/// Wraps [FFplayAndroidSurface] on Android and [FFplayDesktopTexture] on
/// Linux/Windows behind a single API, so callers need no platform checks.
///
/// ### Typical usage
///
/// ```dart
/// // Before starting playback — always create the surface unconditionally:
/// _surface = await FFplaySurface.create();
///
/// final session = await FFplayKit.executeAsync('-i "$path"');
///
/// // Display in the widget tree only when video frames have arrived.
/// // Drive this flag from session.videoSizeStream:
/// if (_hasVideo && _surface != null) ...[
///   AspectRatio(aspectRatio: ar, child: _surface!.toWidget()),
/// ]
///
/// // When done (or on session complete):
/// await _surface?.release();
/// _surface = null;
/// ```
///
/// **Audio-only content** — always call [create] before starting playback.
/// The native layer's `has_video_frames` guard ensures that Flutter's texture
/// system is never given an empty buffer: `copy_pixels` returns `false` until
/// the first decoded video frame arrives.  Because the [Texture] widget is
/// only inserted into the widget tree when `_hasVideo` is true (driven by
/// the video size stream), Flutter never polls the texture for
/// audio-only media and no crash can occur.
///
/// [create] returns `null` on unsupported platforms or if the underlying
/// surface/texture allocation fails.
class FFplaySurface {
  /// Flutter texture ID backing this surface.

  final FFplayDesktopTexture? _desktop;

  FFplaySurface._({required this.textureId, this._android, this._desktop});

  /// Allocates platform-appropriate video surface and wires it to FFplay.
  /// On Android, creates `SurfaceTexture`-backed `ANativeWindow` and calls
  /// `FFplayAndroidSurface.bindToFFplay` automatically. On Linux/Windows/iOS/
  /// macOS, creates a native pixel-buffer texture and registers the frame
  /// callback via the platform plugin.
  /// Call this unconditionally before starting playback — for audio-only files
  /// the surface is allocated but [Texture] widget is never shown (because
  /// `_hasVideo` from the video size stream stays false), so no
  /// frames are ever requested from the native layer.
  /// [width] and [height] are Android-only hints for initial buffer size;
  /// ignored on other platforms.
  /// Returns `null` on unsupported platforms or on allocation failure.
