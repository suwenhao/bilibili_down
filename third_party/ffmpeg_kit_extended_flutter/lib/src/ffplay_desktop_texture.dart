/// Flutter [Texture]-backed desktop surface for FFplay video output.
///
/// On Linux and Windows, FFplay renders frames with SDL2 software renderer.
/// After each `video_refresh` the C++ platform plugin receives decoded pixels
/// through `ffplay_kit_register_frame_callback`, copies them into a
/// `FlutterDesktopPixelBuffer`, and signals Flutter to repaint via
/// `MarkTextureFrameAvailable`. The `Texture` widget composites the
/// current frame into the widget tree.
///
/// ### Typical usage
///
/// ```dart
/// // Before starting playback:
/// _texture = await FFplayDesktopTexture.create();
///
/// final session = await FFplayKit.executeAsync('-i "$path"');
///
/// // Display in the widget tree:
/// _texture?.toWidget()  // use inside AspectRatio / SizedBox
///
/// // When done:
/// await _texture?.release();
/// _texture = null;
/// ```
///
/// On Android, [create] returns `null` and all other methods are no-ops.
///
/// ### API symmetry with `FFplayAndroidSurface`
///
/// Both classes expose `create`, `bindToFFplay`, `toWidget`, and `release`.
/// On desktop, `bindToFFplay` is a no-op because the C++ plugin registers the
/// frame callback automatically when `create` is called.

  /// Flutter texture ID — pass to `Texture(textureId: textureId)`.
  final int textureId;

  FFplayDesktopTexture._({required this.textureId});

  /// Allocates Flutter [Texture] backed by native pixel buffer.
  /// Internally the native plugin:
  ///   1. Registers pixel-buffer texture with Flutter's `TextureRegistrar`.
  ///   2. Calls `ffplay_set_frame_callback` so every decoded video frame is
  ///      delivered to this texture automatically.
  /// Calling `create` while previous texture is active implicitly releases
  /// that texture first (native side replaces global frame callback).
  /// Returns `null` on Android or if texture creation fails.
